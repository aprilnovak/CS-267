\title{MPI Parallelization of a Finite Element Application}

\section{Introduction}

This final project for CS-267 involves the serial creation and parallelization of a finite element solver to the heat equation, which in its simplest form describes the diffusion of temperature with a heat source:

\beq
\label{eq:eq}
-k\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}=\dot{q}
\eeq

where \(k\) is the thermal conductivity, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\dot{q}\) is a volumetric heat source. This equation is kept very simple so that the goals of the project can focus entirely on parallelization algorithms, rather than more advanced numerical methods for solving convection-diffusion equations that would be encountered in a class such as MATH-228b (Numerical Solutions of Differential Equations). Due to the second derivative present in this equation, in 1-D, two boundary conditions are needed on both ends of the domain, and in 2-D, boundary conditions must be known on the entire perimeter. This presents the fundamental difficulty of parallelizing a numerical solution to this equation - if the domain is divided amongst different parallel processes or threads, then the equations cannot be solved unless guesses are made for the conditions on the boundaries that are created upon domain decomposition. Hence, any parallel solution will require an iterative procedure, where an initial guess for the interior boundary conditions are continually updated by comparing results obtained at processor-interfaces. Hence, this application is \textit{not} embarrassingly parallel, and if the number of iterations required to reach convergence is very large, then the parallel runtime can easily be longer than the serial runtime. Hence, clever parallel algorithms will be developed such that a net reduction in runtime and good strong and weak scaling can be obtained for this numerical solution.

From the point of view of parallelization algorithms, the numerical method chosen can have a large impact on the success of strong and weak scaling results. For this project, the finite element method is chosen as the ODE solver because my research focuses on finite element methods applied to the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). This assignment solves the heat equation in 1-D, and time permitting, will also pursue 2-D solutions. The remainder of this section will discuss the numerical method applied to the heat equation in 1-D, and some familiarity with numerical methods is assumed so that the brunt of this report can focus on parallelization rather than numerical methods. A similar approach to homework 2 is pursued here, in that effort is first spent on obtaining fast serial code, followed by the introduction of parallel algorithms to obtain good strong and weak scaling.

The finite element method (FEM) is a weighted residual method, that for parabolic equations can be shown to be optimal in the energy norm (i.e. the FEM solution will outperform {\it all} other solutions when measured in this norm). By multiplying Eq. \eqref{eq:eq} by a test function \(\psi\) and integrating over all space, we obtain the weak form:

\beqa
-\int_{\Omega}k\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}\psi(x)dx=&\int_{\Omega}\dot{q}\psi(x)dx\\
\int_{\Omega}\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}k\frac{\partial\psi(x)}{\partial x}dx-\int_{\Gamma}k\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\psi(x)\cdot\hat{n}dx=&\int_{\Omega}\dot{q}\psi(x)dx\\
\eeqa

where \(\Omega\) indicates the entire domain and \(\Gamma\) the boundary of the domain. Integration by parts has been applied in the second form above to transfer some differentiation from the solution variable \(T\) to the test function \(\psi\). This allows {\it weaker} differentiability requirements for our numerical representation of \(T\), since now the integral only requires that \(T\) be continuous (rather than differentiable as well). Now, an assumption about the form of the solution is made. We assume that the numerical solution \(T_h\) (subscript \(h\) refers to an element of width \(h\)) is a sum of coefficients multiplied by expansion functions \(\phi\):

\beq
T_h=\sum_{j=1}^{N}c_j\phi_j(x)
\eeq

where there are \(N\) of these expansion functions defined over the entire domain. Hence, the numerical method reduces to the problem of determining the expansion coefficietns \(c_j\) for a user-selected set of \(\phi_j(x)\). For parabolic equations, the Galerkin FEM specifies that \(\psi\) should come from the same space as \(T_h\). Hence, inserting these expansions into the weak form gives:

\beqa
\int_{\Omega}\frac{\partial \sum_{j=1}^Nc_j\phi_j(x)}{\partial x}k\frac{\partial\sum_{i=1}^Nb_i\phi_i(x)}{\partial x}dx-\int_{\Gamma}k\frac{\partial \sum_{j=1}^Nc_j\phi_j(x)}{\partial x}\sum_{i=1}^N\phi_i(x)\cdot\hat{n}dx=&\int_{\Omega}\dot{q}\sum_{i=1}^Nb_i\phi_i(x)dx\\
\int_{\Omega}\frac{\partial \sum_{j=1}^Nc_j\phi_j(x)}{\partial x}k\frac{\partial\sum_{i=1}^N\phi_i(x)}{\partial x}dx-\int_{\Gamma}k\frac{\partial \sum_{j=1}^Nc_j\phi_j(x)}{\partial x}\sum_{i=1}^N\phi_i(x)\cdot\hat{n}dx=&\int_{\Omega}\dot{q}\sum_{i=1}^N\phi_i(x)dx\\
\eeqa

where the coefficients \(b_i\) can be cancelled from each term because they are arbitrary. While this equation holds for \(i=1, N\) and \(j=1, N\), it is true that it also holds for each individual selection of \(i\) and \(j\). This stronger requirements allows the summation terms to be removed, with the implication that we have changed one equation to \(N\) equations:

\beqa
c_j\int_{\Omega}\frac{\partial \phi_j(x)}{\partial x}k\frac{\partial\phi_i(x)}{\partial x}dx-c_j\int_{\Gamma}k\frac{\partial \phi_j(x)}{\partial x}\phi_i(x)\cdot\hat{n}dx=&\int_{\Omega}\dot{q}\phi_i(x)dx\\
\eeqa

The above can be written in more concise form using matrix notation. The stiffness matrix \textbf{K} is:

\beq
\label{eq:k}
K_{ij}=\int_{\Omega}\frac{\partial \phi_j(x)}{\partial x}k\frac{\partial\phi_i(x)}{\partial x}dx-\int_{\Gamma}k\frac{\partial \phi_j(x)}{\partial x}\phi_i(x)\cdot\hat{n}dx
\eeq

and the load vector \(\textbf{R}\) is:

\beq
R_{i}=\int_{\Omega}\dot{q}\phi_i(x)dx
\eeq

which gives a set of linear equations that is solved for \(c_j\):

\beq
K_{ij}c_j=R_i
\eeq

The stiffness matrix consists of the multiplication of the derivatives of \(\phi_i(x)\) with \(\phi_j(x)\). If these shape functions are defined over the {\tt entire} domain, then the stiffness matrix will be a dense matrix. On the other hand, if we choose these shape functions to be nonzero only over a single small region of the domain, then the product of cross terms will be zero for most of the matrix, since the effect of a single shape function will be very localized. This will produce sparse matrices, which will be much easier to work with and will also permit easier extension as a numerical method over a discretized domain. Hence, the expansion for the solution and test function for a {\it single} element (``element'' is used in this sense as a small region of the domain, i.e. a meshing software would divide up a continuous domain into discrete elements) becomes:

\beq
T_h^e=\sum_{j=1}^{n_{en}}c_j^e\phi_j^e(x)
\eeq

where the \(e\) superscript indicates the element and \(n_{en}\) are the number of element nodes. A nodal basis is selected for the shape functions. This means that, over a single element, the shape functions are unity at their corresponding node, and zero at the other nodes. The matrix equation \(K_{ij}c_j=R_i\) can be written for written for each individual element, with a post-processing step that takes the system of equations for each element and connects them all together to enforce solution continuity at element interfaces. 

\beq
K_{ij}^ec_j^e=R_i^e
\eeq

where

\beq
K_{ij}^e=\int_{\Omega^e}\frac{\partial \phi_j(x)}{\partial x}k\frac{\partial\phi_i(x)}{\partial x}dx-\int_{\Gamma^e}k\frac{\partial \phi_j(x)}{\partial x}\phi_i(x)\cdot\hat{n}dx
\eeq

\beq
R_{i}^e=\int_{\Omega^e}\dot{q}\phi_i(x)dx
\eeq

such that the domain of integration is only over a single element. However, the system of equations for each element, \(K_{ij}^ec_j^e=R_i^e\), is singular, and cannot be solved independently of the other elements, since we require solution continuity at inter-element nodes. So, the elemental system of equations must be assembled into the global system of equations using a location matrix that dictates how the global nodes in the entire mesh relate to the local node numbering in each finite element. Figure \ref{fig:FEmesh} shows a simple FE mesh, where the numbers illustrate the global node numbering. A mapping is required from the elemental perspective to this global mesh. The location matrix contains this information - each column of the location matrix gives the global node numbers that correspond to the local node numbers. The local nodes must always be numbered in a consistent manner (i.e. always clockwise or always counterclockwise) so that the Jacobian of the local to global transformation is positive. The first five columns of the location matrix for this mesh, for illustration, would be:

\beq
\label{eq:LM}
LM=\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & \cdots\\
2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & \cdots\\
11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & \cdots\\
10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & \cdots\\
\end{bmatrix}
\eeq

where the nodes have been numbered counterclockwise.

\begin{figure}[H]

\label{fig:FEmesh}
\end{figure}

For structured meshed, this location matrix is fairly easy to determine, but for unstructured meshes where there is not necessarily a pattern to the node connectivity, would be provided by a meshing software such as Cubit. Once this location matrix is known, the elemental systems of equations \(K_{ij}^ec_j^e=R_i^e\) can be assembled into the global system of equations \(K_{ij}c_j=R_i\). The fundamental reason why it is preferred to assemble the equations for each element individually, and {\tt then} assemble these into a global system, is that we have chosen shape functions that are only nonzero over an element and its immediate neighbors. This algorithm is inherently local until we get to the step requiring continuity, and it is hence natural to avoid unnecessary computations of zero integrals by only computing the integrals over each element, and then assembling these systems together at the end right before the numerical solve. The following code illustrates how the entries in elementary stiffness matrix {\tt kel} and elementary load vector {\tt rel} are assembled. For better illustration, several entries of \textbf{K} are assembled as follows for the location matrix given in Eq. \eqref{eq:LM}.

\beqa
K(1, 1) =& k(1, 1)^{e=1}\\
K(1, 2) =& k(1, 2)^{e=1}\\
K(2, 2) =& k(2, 2)^{e=1}+k(1, 1)^{e=2}\\
K(2, 11) =& k(2, 3)^{e=1}\\
K(12, 12) =& k(3, 3)^{e=2}+k(4, 4)^{e=3}\\
\eeqa

where a new notation of lowercase \(k\) representing \(K^e\) is used.

\begin{lstlisting}
kel = 0.0
rel = 0.0

do q = 1, n_qp ! loop over the quadrature points
  do i = 1, n_en ! loop over elemental i
    rel(i) = rel(i) + wt(q) * source * phi(i, q) * h *h / 2.0
    do j = 1, n_en ! loop over elemental j
        kel(i, j) = kel(i, j) + wt(q) * dphi(i, q) * k * dphi(j, q) * 2.0
    end do
  end do
end do
\end{lstlisting}

Once the global matrix has been assembled, any Dirichlet boundary conditions must be applied (Neumann boundary conditions have naturally been applied by the form of the perimeter integral in Eq. \eqref{eq:k}. Dirichlet boundary conditions are strictly imposed by removing the Dirichlet nodes from the global matrix system. For a 1-D domain consisting of four linear elements (two nodes per element), the global matrix system \(\textbf{K}c=\textbf{R}\) before imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions is:

\beq
\textbf{K}=
\begin{bmatrix}
k(1, 1)^{e=1} & k(1, 2)^{e=1} & 0 & 0 & 0\\
k(2, 1)^{e=1} & k(2, 2)^{e=1}+k(1, 1)^{e=2} & k(1, 2)^{e=2} & 0 & 0\\
0 & k(2, 1)^{e=2} & k(2, 2)^{e=2}+k(1, 1)^{e=3} & k(1, 2)^{e=3} & 0\\
0 & 0 & k(2, 1)^{e=3} & k(2, 2)^{e=3}+k(1, 1)^{e=4} & k(1, 2)^{e=4}\\
0 & 0 & 0 & k(2, 1)^{e=4} & k(2, 2)^{e=4}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\eeq

\beq
\textbf{R}=\begin{bmatrix}
R_1^{e=1} \\ R_2^{e=1}+R_1^{e=2}\\R_2^{e=2}+R_1^{e=3}\\R_2^{e=3}+R_1^{e=4}\\R_2^{e=4}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\eeq

To apply Dirichlet boundary conditions at nodes \(1\) and \(5\), the off-diagonal terms in the stiffness matrix are set to zero and the corresponding terms in the global load vector are set to the Dirichlet values. For instance, to impose Dirichlet conditions of \(T(node 1)=3.5\) and \(T(node 5) = 10.5\), the global matrix system becomes:

\beq
\textbf{K}=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
k(2, 1)^{e=1} & k(2, 2)^{e=1}+k(1, 1)^{e=2} & k(1, 2)^{e=2} & 0 & 0\\
0 & k(2, 1)^{e=2} & k(2, 2)^{e=2}+k(1, 1)^{e=3} & k(1, 2)^{e=3} & 0\\
0 & 0 & k(2, 1)^{e=3} & k(2, 2)^{e=3}+k(1, 1)^{e=4} & k(1, 2)^{e=4}\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
\end{bmatrix}
\eeq

\beq
\textbf{R}=\begin{bmatrix}
3.5\\ R_2^{e=1}+R_1^{e=2}\\R_2^{e=2}+R_1^{e=3}\\R_2^{e=3}+R_1^{e=4}\\10.5\\
\end{bmatrix}
\eeq

Once these boundary conditions have been incorporated into the matrix system, the matrix system can be solved by your favorite linear algebra routine. For this assignment, the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method is selected to solve this symmetric system because this will provide more flexibility for exploring parallelization algorithms than simply using some routine from BLAS or LAPACK. To solve a matrix system \(\textbf{K}a=R\) by the CG method requires rewriting the governing equation as the minimization of a potential \(\Pi\) (recall from elementary physics classes that you can equivalently state that a system is balance by the sum of the forces equalling zero, {\it or} the total energy of the system being minimized). 

\beq
\label{eq:IterativeMethodsPotential}
\Pi=\frac{1}{2}a^T\textbf{K}a-a^TR
\eeq

The exact solution is obtained by taking the gradient of this potential with respect to each of the expansion coefficients in the vector \(a\), and setting that gradient equal to zero:

\beq
\frac{\partial\Pi}{\partial a}=\textbf{K}a-R=0
\eeq

This is not different than simply solving the original matrix system \(\textbf{K}a-R=0\). So, the minimizer to the potential \(\Pi\) is also a solution to the matrix system. Krylov methods are a class of methods that successively update an initial iterate guess in ways that minimize \(\Pi\) with each iteration. This minimization takes place over a vector space, called a Krylov space. These methods require computation of the residual:

\beq
r^i=R-\textbf{K}a^i
\eeq

where \(i\) is the iteration index. The CG method, while used as an iterative method, is technically a direct method if applied \(N\) times with perfect precision. Each update to the solution iterates is performed according to:

\beq
\label{eq:CGUpdate}
a^{i+1}=a^i+\lambda^iz^i
\eeq

where the update scales by \(z^i\):

\beq
\label{eq:ZUpdateCG}
z^i=r^i+\theta^iz^{i-1}
\eeq

where \(\theta^i\) is a parameter chosen such that \(z^i\) is \(\textbf{K}\)-conjugate to \(z^{i-1}\), or:

\beq
\label{eq:kconjugate}
z^{T,i}\textbf{K}z^{i-1}=0
\eeq

In other words, the search direction is a combination of a move in the reverse direction of the gradient (method of steepest descent) plus a motion perpendicular to that direction. This helps to avoid duplicate searching in the same general area. For the very first iteration, it is common to select \(z^1=r^1\). Simply plugging in Eq. \eqref{eq:ZUpdateCG} to Eq. \eqref{eq:kconjugate} gives:

\beq
\theta^i=-\frac{r^{T,i}\textbf{K}z^{i-1}}{z^{T,i-1}\textbf{K}z^{i-1}}
\eeq

Plugging in Eq. \eqref{eq:CGUpdate} into Eq. \eqref{eq:IterativeMethodsPotential} and then taking the partial derivative with respect to \(\lambda^i\), the optimal \(\lambda^i\) is:

\beq
\label{eq:UpdateCG}
\lambda^i=\frac{z^{T,i}r^i}{z^{T,i}\textbf{K}z^i}
\eeq

So, given an initial guess for the solution \(a\), CG iterations are performed until there is acceptably small difference between two successive iterates \(a^i\) and \(a^{i+1}\). This numerical method is selected due to its relative simplicity. This concludes the theoretical discussion of the FEM applied to this simple 1-D heat equation. The next section discusses steps taken to obtain a fast serial implementation of this algorithm, and will go into more detail regarding exactly how this method can be implemented in code.
